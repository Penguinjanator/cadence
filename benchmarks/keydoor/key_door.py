"""The key-door nursery: delayed credit in one continuing life.

A creature walks a corridor once per episode: empty floor, a chest, a lamp, ``D`` levers
and a door, met in that order; every trip has the same number of cells, so a longer delay
means fewer floor cells before the chest. At every cell it passes or interacts. Under rule
A the chest holds the key; under rule B the lamp does. Interacting at the door with the key
in the pouch pays +1 and ends the episode; interacting with a chest, lamp or lever that
supplies no key costs ``cost``; floor interactions, empty-door interactions and passing
pay nothing. Taking the key pays nothing by itself: its worth
arrives ``D + 2`` cells later from the chest or ``D + 1`` from the lamp, after irrelevant
choices at the levers, so credit cannot
follow the last action blindly. The creature sees the kind of cell it faces and, with the
pouch sense, whether it holds the key. The number of levers varies by the protocol's jitter from episode to
episode: the delay varies in decision counts, with no physical-time interface. The outcome
of the door is delivered with the first
observation of the next episode, ``done`` set, as ``step`` and ``live`` define it. A share
``truncation`` of the trips is cut short before the door, the key lost with them; such a
trip ends with ``done`` clear, so the forecast carries over into the next trip (a truncated
bootstrap), where the door's end is terminal. The reversal chamber of issue 88 is this
chamber's model; this is the delayed key-door reward nursery of
[issue 111](https://github.com/muellerberndt/cadence/issues/111), roadmap row 07.

Arms, all on the same corridor sequence per seed:

- ``live``        ``Brain.compose`` with ``ArousalConfig`` at the protocol's operating point,
                  the simplest existing System 1;
- ``copy``        the ``live`` brain carrying the efference copy of its own last command at
                  the protocol's ``copy`` genes (0.76.0), a declared variant whose founder
                  value, zero, is the ``live`` arm;
- ``step``        the same brain without arousal, learning at every moment (the simpler control);
- ``lambda-zero`` the ``live`` brain with the eligibility decay ``lam`` at zero;
- ``yoked``       the ``live`` brain whose door outcome is paid at a random cell of the next
                  trip instead of at the door: its own earned rewards, with credit retimed;
- ``frozen``      the ``live`` brain after rule A, answering greedily without outcomes;
- ``blind``       the ``live`` brain without the pouch sense;
- ``recurrent``   an online recurrent actor-critic with the same information: the cell kind
                  and the pouch bit enter an Elman hidden layer carried across moments, read
                  by a softmax policy and a linear value, learned with eligibility traces;
- ``tabular``     epsilon-greedy Q(lambda) over (cell, pouch): the matched-information
                  conventional online learner, its settings selected on the development seeds;
- ``random``      uniform random actions.

``key-door/3`` lives through the protocol's ``rules`` in order, chest, lamp and the chest
again, measuring reacquisition after competing experience; its lever count
varies by ``jitter`` cells from trip to trip, the irregular event time of the acceptance.

Readings per rule, over the trips that reached the door: the share of episodes that ended
with food, the share in which the key was taken, the wrong interactions per episode and the
share of door openings with the key, each over the last 50 episodes; the first 20-episode
window with 90% fed; the number of trips cut short; the greedy
choice and the probability of interacting, per cell and pouch state, of a saved and
reloaded copy every 25 episodes; the probability of interacting under the behaviour that
acted and under the base policy, per cell and pouch state, read from the living brain;
the share of aroused moments; and the work of the life. Receipts are ``cadence.Receipt``s
bound to this file and every module of the library. New receipts use ``key-door/3``;
``key-door/2`` receipts are the corrected two-rule instrument, and historical
``key-door/1`` receipts retain their original scheduling and metric limitations.
