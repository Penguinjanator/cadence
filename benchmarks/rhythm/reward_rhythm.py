"""The beat paid by the world: one continuing ``Brain.live`` life learns to alternate two
actions under identical drive from the world's reward alone.

Every moment the walker sees the same drive and pays nothing. A step that differs from
its last step earns one unit, paid at the next moment as the outcome of the preceding
action; a repeated step earns nothing. No teacher labels anything. Nothing in the
observation tells the walker what it did; the only state that can carry the beat is
what it carries itself. This is the reward half of the continuing-action chamber of
issue 116 (roadmap row 06 of issue 109); the supervised half is ``steady_rhythm.py``.

Arms on the same founder weights and the same world: ``live`` (the declared System 1
with the efference copy, routine while outcomes match, aroused and learning when they
do not), ``nocopy`` (the same brain without the copy), ``defaults`` (the copy on the
composed reward defaults instead of the declared operating point), ``step`` (always
learning, every moment sampled), ``lambda_control`` (the eligibility decay at the
protocol's control value, zero unless ``lam_control`` is declared), ``frozen`` (no
learning: the founder's greedy choice, which shows whether a founder had the beat from
birth), ``tabular`` (Q-learning given the one bit the copy carries, the last action),
``random`` (uniform). Mid-life the live brain is
saved with its last action awaiting its outcome; a loaded twin continues beside it.
Forks of the mid-life checkpoint meet a pause of one, two or four silent events, or one
distractor event, and keep living under the same rule.

Run: ``python benchmarks/rhythm/reward_rhythm.py --out DIR``; verify with ``--verify DIR``.
