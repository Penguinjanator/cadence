"""The loop chamber of issue 140: a brain taught to predict the next event of a periodic
pattern plays it in the closed loop, hearing its own output, from a prime.

A brain that predicts well on held-out rows can collapse, when fed its own output, to one
trajectory that does not depend on the prime: on the C64 rows of 0.73.1 the loop held forever,
because a brain that cannot count rows since its last onset, hearing its own holds, has hold as
its only consistent answer. This chamber is the smallest version of that observation: one
voice, an onset every ``period`` rows, the heard event and a constant drive as the only input,
the next event as the only label.

This is an engineered sensory-history comparison, not a supported use of the public
own-command efference contract or a repair of issue 140. The adapter writes heard inputs
directly into the efference storage and restores that storage after acts. It supplies a
decaying input-history feature; the next event remains a teaching label only. The
heard event enters the copy before the brain answers a row, in teaching, in watching and in
the prime of a play, and the brain's own command is taken back out of it, so that the copy
carries the heard stream alone; in the closed loop the brain's own command is the heard event
and stays. Without that contract a brain whose copy holds only its own greedy commands never
has an onset in it while it still emits holds, and the majority fixed point seals itself.
Teaching uses an explicit label-based mismatch policy, not ``Brain.live``: a row answered
right teaches nothing, a wrong or refused answer is followed by one lesson on that row;
a lesson on every row (the
watching recipe of the C64 lane) made the pattern come and go from pass to pass on the
development seeds. Arms on the same founder weights and the same rows:

- ``copy``      the copy at the protocol's decay under the declared contract;
- ``own``       the same copy, written only by the brain's own greedy commands (the simpler
                control of the contract);
- ``nocopy``    no copy: the working trace alone (the 0.73.1 setting);
- ``frozen``    the ``copy`` founder without lessons, played under the same contract (a beat
                from birth is not credited);
- ``ngram``     a table over the last ``period`` events, taught on the same rows: the matched
                conventional learner that counts explicitly;
- ``hold``      hold forever; ``random`` uniform random events.

Every brain arm is first watched: from reset it hears the taught rows once more with free
greedy acts and no lesson, and its agreement with the next event is the open-loop reading (the
agreement inside teaching precedes any conditional lesson on the same row). Then every arm
plays closed loops of ``rows`` rows from primes at every
phase of the pattern. Readings: onset rate against the truth's, agreement with the primed
pattern's own continuation, agreement with the other phases' continuations (prime dependence)
and the pairwise correlation of the plays across primes (the issue's own measure). Receipts
bind the chamber and the library. Run ``python benchmarks/rhythm/loop_rhythm.py --out DIR``.
