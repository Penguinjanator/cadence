"""Brain regions: functional parts of one brain, blank or designed.

A ``Region`` is a named group of neurons. A blank region is only a size: a ``Genome`` gives
it projections to and from other regions, and evolution may change the size. A designed
region carries its own circuit, a ``Connectome`` of its neurons, the synapses among them and
named populations, and keeps its size under mutation. ``inputs`` names the population that
receives projections and ``outputs`` the population that sends them; either defaults to the
whole region.

Every region of a brain settles in the same equilibrium as every other region: a region is
a part of one connectome and one ``Brain``, never a separately settled model.

The standard regions are engineering analogues named for their intended functions:

* ``visual_cortex``: a retinotopic input layer and feature maps of neurons with local
  receptive fields, as in primary visual cortex.
* ``cortex``: a cortical area, optionally with lateral inhibition among its neurons; the
  association cortex of a generic brain.
* ``motor_cortex``: one neuron per action, optionally with lateral inhibition, read out as a
  choice.
* ``prefrontal_cortex``: a working-memory population with one neuron per neuron of the region
  it holds, driven by a ``Trace`` of that region's activity.

Three cortices keep their state outside the connectome. The records cortex (``Records``) codes
a mean-free reading sparsely and keeps one record per cell for every predicted field, read
through the active cells and written by the delta rule, as in the cerebellum and the dentate
gyrus. The basal ganglia (``ActorCritic``) read cortex through learned corticostriatal weights
and broadcast a dopamine prediction error. The hippocampus (``FastSynapses``) keeps one-trial
associations per stream. ``GenericBrain`` composes the regions, the basal ganglia and the
hippocampus into one ready brain.
