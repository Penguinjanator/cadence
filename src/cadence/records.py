"""Records: what followed each reading, kept where the reading lands.

A reading is the drive of the neurons a patch reads: sensory fields with their missing
flags, the goal, the action, the reads of declared stores. Each unit's running mean is
subtracted, so the code follows what deviates from the usual reading and a small cue can
move it. A fixed random projection maps the reading onto many cells; the most active cells
stay and the rest are inhibited. Each predicted field keeps a table with one record per
cell. The read of a reading is the sum of its active cells' records, weighted by their
activity; the witnessed outcome is written into exactly those records by the delta rule.
A reading touches few records, so one outcome is written almost exactly and a reading
elsewhere leaves it intact: records learn from one stream without replay.

Two codes come from one reading. The plain code serves the consequence fields. The valued
code first divides every declared input pathway by its running norm, so the goal and a
remembered cue have the same say as the senses; the valued fields (reward, terminal value)
read and write through it at their own rate.

The running mean settles: it is the plain average of the readings seen until one over their
count falls to the habituation rate, and follows at that rate after. A settled mean keeps the
code of a reading where its records were written; a mean that keeps moving would carry old
readings onto cells that were never written.

Task sets keep the values of one task away from the values of another. When ``tasks`` names
the reading's task units (a goal port with one active unit), the cells are divided into one
group per task unit, and a reading's valued code draws its winners from the group of the
active task; the plain code and the consequence records stay shared by every task. A reward
earned under one goal is then written into cells no other goal reads, and a cue learned for
one task survives the rewards of the tasks that follow.

The projection is drawn from ``Mulberry32``, the generator of ``brain_scan.js``, so a page
rebuilds the same cells from the seed.
