"""Cadence: research toward general intelligence through local repair.

Bounded observer-like patches carry state, expose ports and readback, and repair
shared relationships. ``TemporalPatchNet`` learns observed paths by centered
equilibrium detuning, carries context, imagines privately and repairs continuous
action proposals under the same learned model. ``TemporalMemory`` adds explicit
conditional response protection. Actual outcomes remain distinct from desired
or imagined outcomes.

The research goal is reusable learning, retention, creativity and evolving
functional self-reflection across applications. Current APIs expose tested
operations; they do not establish general intelligence or an automatically
learned recursive hierarchy. See the architecture and interaction guides.

``PatchNet``, ``Brain``, ``Learner``, ``GenericBrain``, ``Records`` and graph
construction/evolution helpers remain supported as distinct compatibility
compositions. Their optional mechanisms are not required by the temporal core.
