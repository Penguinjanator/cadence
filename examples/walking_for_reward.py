"""A walker learns the beat from the world's reward alone: no teacher, no clock.

Run from this checkout: PYTHONPATH=src python examples/walking_for_reward.py

One continuing `Brain.live` life sees the same drive every moment. A step on the
other foot than the last one earns one unit, paid at the next moment as the
outcome of that step; a repeated step earns nothing. Nothing in the observation
says which foot moved last. The walker carries an efference copy of its own last
command (`efference_amplitude=3.0, efference_decay=0.0`); the control is the
same founder without the copy. Both run the key-door nursery's declared
operating point and arousal genes: aroused and learning through a youth of 100
moments, then routine while the outcomes match what it expects and aroused
again when they do not or when its need goes unmet.

The example prints, per block of 100 moments, how often each walker changed
foot, how often it was aroused, and its income; then the beat of the last 64
moments against a uniform-random walker, a greedy twin loaded from a mid-life
checkpoint (the acquired policy without exploration), the twin's identical
continuation beside the living walker, and the work of each mode. The
reward-rhythm chamber (`benchmarks/rhythm/reward_rhythm.py`) is the frozen
instrument with its fresh seeds, controls and receipts; this example shows one
founder and claims nothing beyond what it prints.
