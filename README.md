**One continuing equilibrium brain: learn a world, act in it, repair what fails.**

Cadence is not a feed-forward deep neural network. Its primary application is
one acquired brain continuing through experience.

Cadence aims to build a simulated human-like brain from simplified biological
mechanisms. Its default **System 1** is a continuing animal-like brain with
perception, plastic connections, memory and action. Optional **System 2** adds
recursive feedback through observing cortical regions in the same neural graph.
The base can already be deep and modular. Biological names describe functional
software roles.

Bounded, observer-like regions carry local neural state. The composition declares
sensory and motor indices, exposes activity for readback and retains working
traces and cue/outcome associations. Reciprocal regions constrain one another
as the neural graph settles; actions require its full equations to qualify.
Actual observations and consequences guide local plasticity and memory writes.
The aim is to bootstrap a useful interpretation, use it in an ongoing life, and
repair witnessed failures while retaining the same acquired brain.

Learned parameters and memories support a **family of equilibria** under changing
evidence and context. They do not hold the brain at one frozen state. An internally
consistent answer can still be wrong about the world: numerical settlement and
useful understanding need separate evidence.

Start with [one continuing equilibrium brain](https://github.com/muellerberndt/cadence/blob/main/docs/world-model.md), the canonical
guide to this lifecycle and its current implementation boundaries. `Brain.compose`
already supplies continuing action, local learning and memory, and `Brain.live`
adds a first routine-and-repair loop for one stream, measured on one bounded
chamber. Integrated learned world prediction, repair localized to what failed
and cheap stable operation remain development goals. Cadence is alpha research software.

The examples and guides use Cadence 0.75.0, including action diagnostics through
`Brain.last_settlement`. This release adds `Brain.live`, the routine-and-repair loop
of one continuing stream with its arousal genes, and the odour nursery that measures
it; the settling, learning and memory equations and the composed defaults are those
of 0.74.0.
Start with the simplest existing System 1: proposed additions must remain local
repair within the same equilibrium and demonstrate benefit without losing
working capabilities. Animal and human brains guide the abstraction, including
finite capacity and possible rigidity.

## How a Cadence brain differs from a feed-forward network

`Brain.compose(inputs=4, actions=2, modules=(64, 32, 16))` builds reciprocal
processing regions whose activity settles together. Later regions can shape
earlier ones while an answer forms. Working and associative memory contribute to
the current drive; the selected motor action comes from the qualified neural
state. An external trained readout would be a separate answer-producing model.

The graph learner compares local activities in free and nudged phases, without
a backward differentiation pass through those phases. Default teaching and
reward eligibility are finite; `LearnerConfig(qualified=True, ...)` explicitly
requires supervised phases to qualify before updating. Other Cadence model
families have [their own learning contracts](https://github.com/muellerberndt/cadence/blob/main/docs/contracts.md), including
explicit adjoints in record and belief models.

Independent classification and calibration remain useful mechanism tests.
They do not exercise the complete continuing brain. Recurrent networks trained
by backpropagation can also learn online and use memory: the relevant comparison
is acquired behavior and total work on the same task and information, not an
architectural label. See [the update mechanisms](https://github.com/muellerberndt/cadence/blob/main/docs/concepts.md#compared-with-backprop-networks).

## Why Cadence

The library makes continuing state, reciprocal interpretation, local plasticity
and memory available in one small interface. A saved brain can resume an action
awaiting its actual outcome. Private imagination can inspect responses without
rewriting live experience. These are mechanisms for testing acquisition,
retention and recovery through a life.

The target includes full-sentence language and reusable world understanding.
A small fixed-label task is a control, not that destination. Greater capability,
scalability and efficiency than transformers must be established with matched
comparisons. A small numerical residual does not measure low physical energy
or guarantee a correct answer.

## Start with System 1

Python 3.11+ and NumPy are required.
Install the published release for this basic example:

```sh
python -m pip install cadence-net==0.75.0
```

Its [released documentation](https://github.com/muellerberndt/cadence/blob/v0.75.0/docs/README.md)
describes the APIs included in that package.

```python
import numpy as np
from cadence import Brain

brain = Brain.compose(inputs=4, actions=2, modules=(16, 8), seed=7)
observation = np.array([[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]])
action = brain.step(observation)

# A tiny environment rewards action 0 and supplies the next observation.
reward = (action == 0).astype(float)
next_observation = np.array([[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]])
action = brain.step(next_observation, reward=reward, done=np.array([False]))
assert action.shape == (1,)
```

`step` learns from the **preceding action's** measured reward, then chooses the
next action. `teacher=` can label the **current observation**. Keep each batch
row attached to the same life. There is no training/inference mode switch.
[Continuous interaction](https://github.com/muellerberndt/cadence/blob/main/docs/continuous.md)
covers teaching, resets and saved continuation.
The [continuing brain example](https://github.com/muellerberndt/cadence/blob/main/examples/continuing_brain.py) keeps the same brain
through bootstrap, unchanged conditions, disruption and correction, then checks
a checkpoint awaiting feedback. It records task outcomes and free-answer work
separately, and teaches a repeated cue only after a witnessed mistake. Real
reward learning and associative writes still process every observed outcome.

The constructor includes a working trace and fast/persistent associative memory.
The trace carries recent activity; learned graph parameters and consolidated
associations retain changes across resets. A current teacher changes graph
parameters. Actual chosen-action outcomes write associative memory. `act` reads
both memory pathways; independent `predict` and `accuracy` read neither, so they
measure the graph's learned response. Capacity is finite; overlapping associations
and further plasticity can interfere with recall.

```python
phases = brain.imagine([observation, next_observation])
assert phases  # Inspect phase.converged before using an imagined response.
```

Imagination carries a private trace without changing live memory, random state
or pending feedback. It evaluates responses to the observations you supply.
For learned environmental consequences and action planning, use the separate
[temporal model](https://github.com/muellerberndt/cadence/blob/main/docs/interaction.md).

To work from source, install from the library repository root:

```sh
python -m pip install -e .
```

This installs the local source as an editable package.

The API keeps each completed action solve's residual, qualification,
sweeps and check counts in read-only `brain.last_settlement`, including refused
attempts. These diagnostics exclude learning, reward eligibility and memory work.
The [quickstart](https://github.com/muellerberndt/cadence/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md#inspect-the-work-of-answering) shows how to
inspect them; the continuing example also records other settling phases.
Cheap routine operation and a useful response to surprise must be measured,
not inferred from a small residual.

## Add optional System 2

```python
recursive = Brain.compose(
    inputs=4, actions=2, modules=(16, 8), observers=(8,), seed=7,
)
```

Observer regions read and return influence to the base, motor regions and earlier
observers. They join the same settlement and use the same interaction interface.
This makes recursive feedback available; learning when it helps remains a task
for experience and evaluation.

Actions and independent predictions require the full neural equation residual
to meet the configured tolerance. Exhausting the budget refuses an action without
changing its live state, memory or pending feedback. If `step` has learned a real
outcome before the next action refuses, retry `act` without submitting that reward
again. Numerical damping stays within the total budget and checks the original
equations. It does not change the teaching rule. See [contracts](https://github.com/muellerberndt/cadence/blob/main/docs/contracts.md).

## Related physics project

Cadence shares its basic principle with
[Observer Patch Holography](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography)
(OPH), a physics project that uses local repair to derive the laws of physics. In
OPH, observer patches repair disagreements where they overlap until the whole
network is consistent. In Cadence, neurons settle against what their connections
predict, and learning changes those connections locally.

## Cadence memecoin

Cadence has an official memecoin on Solana. Its token address is
`46doJPsSjEVMsNZm4b32UbbvbUXjFTM3TDPBWMM3pump`
([chart on Dexscreener](https://dexscreener.com/solana/4tjiqzqocttntmdqqmev2spoegzipuerfyramnfxv9su)).
Any other token using the Cadence name is unrelated to this project.

Pragma Research did not deploy the token and holds none of it. It was set up so
that Bernhard Mueller can claim all the SOL fees it generates, and those fees
have been a very helpful source of funding for Cadence.

Cadence itself does not use the token, and no integration into the core library
is planned. We encourage the crypto community to build interesting projects that
integrate it.

Nothing here is financial advice.
