# Learning: the free/nudged rule

Start with [a settling brain that decides](quickstart.md#a-settling-brain-that-decides).
This page explains local prediction repair and demonstrations without adaptation: the neuron
equations, a numerical update, the gradient assumptions, and configuration choices.
This rule changes the synapses of the settled regions. A [records cortex](memory.md#records)
learns consequences and reward with one read and one delta-rule write per outcome, without
settling phases.

## 1. What learning changes

A `Brain` carries three parameter arrays:

- `efficacy`, one signed synaptic efficacy per synapse. The effective drive of synapse `e`
  per unit of presynaptic activation is `gain · count[e] · efficacy[e] · exp(log_gain[pre[e]])`;
  in a brain built by `layered` with `learning_neuron_model()`, `gain`, `count`, and
  `log_gain` are 1, 1, and 0, so the drive is just `efficacy[e]`. Call it `W[e]`.
- `bias`, one number per neuron.
- `log_gain`, one per neuron, which the learner leaves alone.

Learning moves `efficacy` and `bias`. The connectome stays fixed: which neurons synapse
onto which never changes, and learning changes only how strongly each synapse drives.

## 2. What settling computes

Each neuron `i` holds a potential `v[i]` and publishes an activation `s[i]`. One step of the
neuron model, applied to every neuron at once:

    synaptic_input[i] = sum over synapses e with post[e] = i of  W[e] · s[pre[e]]
    total[i] = synaptic_input[i] + stimulus[i] + bias[i]     (+ nudge[i] in a nudged phase)
    v[i]    <- v[i] + dt · (total[i] - v[i])
    s[i]     = act(v[i])

Each neuron relaxes its potential toward its total input. `act` is the neuron model's
activation function. `learning_neuron_model()` sets slope 1, threshold 0, and leak 0.1:

    act(v) = tanh(v / 2)          for v >= 0
    act(v) = 0.1 · tanh(v / 2)    for v <  0

so rest (`v = 0`) publishes exactly 0, positive drive saturates toward 1 around `v ≈ 4`,
and negative drive publishes a small negative number instead of a hard zero. Settling
repeats this step from rest (or from a given state) until no neuron's activation moves
more than `tolerance` in one step, or until the step cap. A readout sees that state.

An input enters as a *stimulus*, a fixed drive on the input neurons with one number per
neuron (a pixel's level, a board cell's occupancy). In a `layered` connectome, input
neurons have no inbound synapses. With zero input bias, at equilibrium each sits at
`v = stimulus` and publishes `act(stimulus)`. Other connectomes can feed back into inputs.

## 3. The two phases and the update

For a batch of inputs with targets:

**Free phase.** Settle under the input stimulus alone. Call the rest state `s⁰`. The output
neurons' activations are the brain's answer; no target has entered.

**Nudged phases.** From `s⁰`, settle again with an extra drive on the output neurons only:

    nudge[i] = beta · weight · (target[i] - p[i])      for output neurons i
    p        = softmax(s[outputs] / T)

`p` is a softmax over the output neurons, so pushing the target's neuron up pushes the
others down by their share (a cross-entropy nudge). `weight` is 1 for a label; for a
reward it is the advantage of the action (see [reward](reward.md)). With `centered=True`
(the default) two nudged phases run from the same `s⁰`: one with `+beta`, rest state
`s⁺`, and one with `-beta`, rest state `s⁻`. The nudge travels back over the feedback
synapses, so hidden neurons rest at slightly different activations in the two phases.

**Update.** Every synapse reads its own presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the two
phases, and every neuron reads itself:

    contrast[e]  = mean over the batch of ( s⁺[pre[e]] · s⁺[post[e]] - s⁻[pre[e]] · s⁻[post[e]] ) / (2 beta)
    bias_term[i] = mean over the batch of ( s⁺[i] - s⁻[i] ) / (2 beta)

    efficacy[e] += eta   · contrast[e]
    bias[i]     += eta_b · bias_term[i]

The synapse term is a local, Hebbian-like quantity: the product of presynaptic and
postsynaptic activity in one nudged phase minus the same product in the other.

Two more details, both in `Learner.update`. With `reciprocal=True` (the default), a synapse
and its reverse (`i → j` and `j → i`) form a *reciprocal synapse pair* with one shared
efficacy, so their two contrasts are averaged and both directions move by the same amount.
A plastic efficacy's magnitude is clipped to eight; frozen efficacies are preserved.
With `centered=False` the second nudged phase is skipped and `s⁻` is replaced by `s⁰` with
`beta` in place of `2 beta`.

The implementation retains the free and nudged states and optimizer history;
it does not retain a backward computation graph. Softmax reads its declared output
group, and weight tying aggregates the members of a declared tie group. These two
operations read a group of neurons or synapses, beyond the per-synapse contrast.

## 4. One observation repairs a settled prediction

For a custom world model, save a free prediction under the current observation
and proposed action with `Learner.free`. Only after the environment executes the
action does its observed consequence enter the teaching target.
Both nudged phases start from that same free state under the original drive.
Their endpoint contrast changes synapses for future encounters.

The records cortex learns consequences with one read and one write. Use this settled
repair where the prediction must complete a partial reading, or where the readout is the
policy under late credit. The repair assigns no credit across delays: use explicit
temporal state and [reward eligibility](reward.md) where the task needs them. Score
outcomes before updating, and keep imagined or teacher-nudged states out of
witnessed-event memory.

## 5. Why the contrast is a gradient

Let `F` be the recurrent neurons and hold the input activations fixed. With no adaptation,
symmetric **effective** recurrent weights, and a monotone differentiable activation,
the continuous-time dynamics descend

    E(v_F) = Σ_{i∈F} ∫₀^{v[i]} u · act'(u) du
             − ½ Σ_{i,j∈F} W[i→j] s[i] s[j] − Σ_{i∈F} d[i] s[i]
    d[i] = stimulus[i] + bias[i] + Σ_{k input} W[k→i] s[k]

The one-way input projections belong in `d`, outside the symmetric recurrent sum.
A finite Euler step need not lower this energy. A stationary point need not be a
minimum or unique. Tying `efficacy` alone does not make effective weights symmetric
if opposite contact counts or presynaptic gains differ.

On a smooth stable equilibrium branch, converged free/nudged phases obey the
[equilibrium-propagation identity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05179): the limiting
contrast is minus the loss gradient with respect to the weight of a reciprocal synapse
pair. The pair has one weight, so its two identical directed contrasts
must not be summed twice. For a quadratic nudge the loss is half squared error.
Cadence's cross-entropy drive omits `1/T`, so its loss is **T times cross-entropy**.
The [centered estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03824) cancels the leading nudge
bias on a sufficiently smooth branch; a finite nudge crossing a kink or a different
attractor need not have that accuracy.

`Learner.contrast` returns a statistic, and `Learner.update` keeps the library's
step convention. When `c[e] = gain * count[e] * exp(log_gain[pre[e]])`
is not one, conversion to minus the gradient with respect to a tied `efficacy`
requires multiplying by `c[e]` (assuming the factors of the two directions agree). For
ordinary cross-entropy also divide by `T`. Bias gradients need the same loss scaling but no
contact factor. Sharing a parameter across several distinct synapses gives a sum of
contributions; the implementation uses their mean as a step-size convention.
Explicit tie groups and reciprocal pairs are combined transitively. Tying constrains
increments, so tied initial efficacies must agree if their values should remain equal.
Frozen members contribute zero to the averaged increment and remain fixed.
`tests/test_equilibrium.py` checks the scale conversion against finite differences.

A small activation change is not a fixed-point certificate: saturation or tiny `dt`
can make it small while the potential is far from rest. Check the neuron equations:

```python
free = learner.free(drive)
remaining = learner.brain.residual(drive, free)  # one diagnostic value per batch row
```

For a nudged phase, pass its actual `nudge` too, and inspect the result before changing
the brain's parameters. The diagnostic uses one transport evaluation and does not settle
again. `learning_neuron_model` provides responsive defaults, but cannot guarantee convergence,
uniqueness, or accurate credit for every connectome. The leak keeps a small response
below rest; it does not remove saturation or make the piecewise activation globally smooth.

## Feedback and the reach of a nudge

A contrast is zero if neither the presynaptic nor the postsynaptic neuron changes under
the nudge. Hidden neurons therefore need a directed feedback path from nudged outputs.
`layered` supplies tied feedback between hidden and output neurons. A general
directed graph may provide some such paths and omit others. Asymmetry among free neurons
breaks the energy-gradient argument above. One-way projections from fixed external inputs
do not: a source neuron at its unchanged equilibrium supplies a constant field to the free
subsystem. `ep_structure(brain, fixed_inputs=...)` checks this structural distinction; it
does not check convergence or certify finite-beta accuracy. Feedback reachability alone does not ensure
useful credit if activations saturate or phases fail to converge.

For a measured connectome, distinguish the supplied topology from an assumed learning
mechanism. Adding reverse synapses changes the model. Test that modelling choice
with controls rather than treating it as a biological consequence.

## 6. Using it

For an individual prediction head, construct `(batch, connectome.n)` drives from the
pre-action context. `step` takes integer outcome/action indices within the output group;
for `slots`, use one index per row and slot. `accuracy` is the fraction of correct
choices over all rows and slots. Use [explicit target patterns](tasks.md#pattern-targets)
for regression or reconstruction.

`LearnerConfig` is frozen. To change the learning rate between completed updates:

```python
from dataclasses import replace

# After a completed update on your own Learner:
learner.config = replace(learner.config, eta=0.5)
```

`learner.brain` is a plain `Brain` at every moment. Settle it, run `conformance` on
it, export `learner.brain.dense()` for a page, or put its `to_dict()` in a receipt.

## 7. Every knob

| knob | where | what it does | where to start |
|---|---|---|---|
| `beta` | `LearnerConfig` | nudge strength; smaller is closer to the gradient, larger a stronger signal | 0.1 |
| `free_steps`, `nudged_steps` | `LearnerConfig` | the most steps a free and a nudged phase may take before the contrast is read | 100, 50 |
| `tolerance` | `LearnerConfig` | settling stops once no neuron's activation moves more than this (None: the step cap alone) | 1e-4 |
| `eta` | `LearnerConfig` | efficacy step; the contrast is divided by `2 beta` | default 0.2; tune on held-out experience |
| `eta_bias` | `LearnerConfig` | bias step | `eta / 10` (the default) |
| `temperature` | `LearnerConfig` | softmax temperature of the cross-entropy nudge; also the policy temperature when sampling actions | 0.1 (labels), 0.2 (actions) |
| `centered` | `LearnerConfig` | contrast `+beta` against `−beta` (two nudged phases) rather than against the free state | `True` |
| `nudge` | `LearnerConfig` | `"cross_entropy"` or `"quadratic"` (`beta · (target − s)`) | cross-entropy for classes |
| `momentum` | `LearnerConfig` | each efficacy steps on a bias-corrected running average of its contrast | 0 (off); tune with the learning rate |
| `decay` | `LearnerConfig` | every update shrinks each plastic efficacy and bias by this fraction | 0 by default; decay also forgets useful weights |
| `normalize`, `normalize_floor` | `LearnerConfig` | divide each efficacy's step by its bias-corrected running RMS plus a floor | 0 (off); tune on validation; combining momentum and RMS gives an Adam-style update |
| `reciprocal` | `Learner` | tie each synapse and its reverse into a reciprocal pair with one efficacy | `True` |
| `plastic_synapses` | `Learner` | bool per synapse; the others keep their efficacy | all |
| `plastic_neurons` | `Learner` | bool per neuron; the others keep their bias | all |
| `synapse_rate` | `Learner` | a nonnegative step multiplier per synapse, applied before tying | `None` (every synapse at `eta`) |
| `leak`, `slope`, `dt` | `learning_neuron_model` | sub-rest response, activation slope, integration step of the neuron update | 0.1, 1.0, 0.5 to 1.0 |
| `density`, `feedback`, `lateral`, `init`, `skip` | `layered` | input→hidden density, feedback scale, output↔output scale, initial magnitude, direct input→output synapses | 0.3 (the default; 1.0 for small brains), 1.0, 0, 1.0, `False` |

`Learner.parameters()` counts plastic efficacies (a reciprocal pair or tie group counts
once) plus plastic neuron biases. A plastic synapse whose reverse is frozen still contributes
one trainable efficacy. Report optimizer arrays and episodic memory separately when comparing
storage; parameter count alone does not measure execution cost.

## 8. Warm starts, costs, and what to expect

A free phase may start from an earlier state (`learner.free(drive, warm=state)` or
`learner.step(..., warm=state)`). Within the same attracting basin this can save settling
steps; with multiple attractors it can change the answer. A capped warm phase deliberately
retains transients and is not necessarily an equilibrium. Reset state at independent
episode boundaries and compare warm and cold settling on changing inputs.

Each centered update runs three settling phases. Measure all phase steps and wall time; fewer
epochs do not by themselves mean greater sample efficiency or lower compute. When the
task is to learn what follows a reading, a [records cortex](memory.md#records) reads with
one product and writes with one delta-rule step per outcome, without settling phases.
