# Scaling learned capability

Cadence aims to improve useful behavior through more experience and training,
without redesigning the brain for each application. A bounded observer-like
patch exposes local state, ports, records and readback; learning repairs its
relationships. Scaling this structure is an empirical requirement, not a
consequence of naming it a brain or reaching an equilibrium.

## Separate the causes of improvement

| Variable | Controlled comparison |
| --- | --- |
| Unique experience | Nested sets of distinct observations; equal update count and batch size. |
| Training exposure | The same training set and initialization, evaluated at predeclared update counts. |
| Model capacity | The same observations, ports, objective and evaluation at different hidden widths. |
| Temporal scope | Longer experienced sequences, counting both episodes and scalar teaching values. |
| Internal readback | Aligned feedback versus disconnected, shuffled and equally capable recurrent controls. |

Keep evaluation data separate, use several initializations and report each
paired result. Seeds on one dataset do not establish robustness across data
distributions. More steps with a short temporal objective need not teach a
longer task. Increasing width can worsen optimization or long-path behavior.

Before comparing neural models, establish simple controls: training-set means,
last-observation persistence, an appropriate fitted linear predictor and a
known-body controller where available. A context-sensitive prediction can still
lose to a constant. A copied target, new decoder, additional supplied intention
or expanded action vocabulary is a changed interface, not data scaling.

## Count the full work

Report attempted and committed updates, phase failures, parameter replays,
block-chain attempts, solver tolerances, persistent state and transient work.
Keep every scheduled seed in the report, including unattempted or time-capped
cells. Compare equal checkpoints; never substitute an early result for a
missing late checkpoint or compare unmatched averages as a paired effect.
Wall-clock limits depend on host contention, so include operation counts too.

The NumPy temporal implementation has dense hidden-width messages. For batch
size N, path length T and hidden width H, one detuned chain factorization costs
on the order of N*T*H³ operations. Its explicit message storage is
8*N*T*(H²+H) bytes in float64; Hessian blocks, arrays, clones and solver
workspace cost more. Free causal prediction avoids this factorization but has
a sequential dependency across time. A GPU backend for a different graph API
does not accelerate this temporal kernel automatically.

Longer and wider runs therefore need measured numerical conditioning and a
verified implementation path before hardware scaling. Treat speed and task
quality as separate measurements. No general Cadence scaling law has been
established.

## Keep manual design visible

Record supplied encodings, timing, topology, sample banks, goals, loss weights,
selection rules and optimization constants. Distinguish them from learned
relationships. Prefer a correction that improves the same learning operation
across domains to another named task module. Parameter-step backtracking, for
example, can prevent overshoot without supplying a task's answer, but it does
not determine relevance or protect old experience.

A useful general improvement must eventually combine acquisition, retention,
correction and novel behavior. Establish these at small scale before a long
run. In creative applications, evaluate novelty, purpose, coherent development
and actual execution separately from prediction loss. Musical composition is
one application of this general contract.
