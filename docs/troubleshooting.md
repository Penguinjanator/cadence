# Troubleshooting

Short answers to the questions builders ask first, each pointing at the page that has
the rest. [Common missteps](missteps.md) is the longer list of ways a good-looking
number can be wrong.

## Install and run

**`pip install cadence-net` and then `import cadence`.** The distribution is `cadence-net`;
the import is `cadence`. Python 3.11 or newer and NumPy are the only requirements.

**Do I need a GPU?** No. Everything runs on NumPy float64. `[fast]` adds Numba and SciPy
for the settling brain's transport, `[accel]` adds torch and `[apple]` adds MLX for the
settling brain on a device; the temporal and record patches are NumPy, and the belief
patch's slow half has a torch twin ([backends](backends.md)).

**`cadence-demo` opens nothing.** It serves a local page and opens the browser; pass
`--no-browser` and open the printed address, or `--port` if the default is taken. A run
trains the brain first and takes seconds to a minute ([the quickstarts in your browser](demos.md)).

**Which brain do I want?** The table at the end of the [quickstarts](quickstart.md#which-one);
[build your own brain](build.md) walks each one from your data.

## Shapes and encodings

**`ValueError` on shapes.** Settling brains take a drive of shape `(batch, n)` with one
column per neuron of the connectome, and `Learner.step` takes integer labels of shape
`(batch,)`. Temporal, record and belief patches take paths `(batch, time, ports)` and
targets `(batch, time, outputs)`; a single moment is `(batch, 1, ports)`. The
[shapes table](orientation.md#shapes) lists every brain.

**Categorical outputs.** For a record patch declare `groups=(k,)` and give one-hot
targets; the readout ends in a softmax per group. For a settling brain the outputs are
neurons and `step` takes the index of the wanted one. A temporal patch's outputs are
continuous levels.

**An absent observation is not a zero.** Zeros mean zero drive. Add a presence port when
an observed zero must differ from no observation ([temporal learning](temporal.md#context-private-continuation-and-readback)).

## The settling brain

**Accuracy stays at chance.** Call `learner.calibrate(drive)` first, so the free motor
activity sits in its responsive range. Check that a nudge on the outputs can reach the
hidden neurons: the projection into the output region must be reciprocal
(`Projection(..., reciprocal=True)`, the default). Then raise `eta` (1.0 is a good start
on a small brain) and keep `beta` around 0.1 ([every knob](learning.md#7-every-knob)).

**The phases do not converge.** Raise `free_steps` and `nudged_steps` in `LearnerConfig`,
or lower the gain. Check `brain.residual(drive, state)`: a small movement per step can hide
a large equation error when neurons saturate ([concepts](concepts.md#settling-and-equilibrium)).

**Is the answer an equilibrium?** `cd.certificate(brain)` says whether settling is a
contraction and bounds the remaining distance; when the row mass is above the limit,
`brain.equilibrate` with a tolerance and `brain.residual` are the checks
([certificate](certificate.md)).

**Two heads on one brain.** An update replaces `learner.brain`; hand the new brain to the
other head before its next phase, and give each head disjoint plasticity masks
([which synapses a head owns](cortex.md#which-synapses-a-head-owns)).

## The temporal patch

**`observe` returns `updated=False`.** Read `result.reason`. `contrast_asymmetric` means
the two detuned paths did not sit symmetrically around the free path even after halving
`beta`: lower `beta`, shorten the path or the hidden width. A failed phase names the
phase; `no_decreasing_parameter_step` with `backtrack=True` means no rate lowered the loss
in replay ([checking a learning step](temporal.md#checking-a-learning-step)).

**The plan reports `step_cap`.** Reaching the cap is not convergence, and control can improve
all the same: execute the first action, measure, replan. `method="bfgs"` takes fewer iterations
on a badly conditioned action path ([planning](planning.md)).

**Zero free energy, wrong predictions.** The causal recurrence has zero defect by
construction. Surprise is the observation minus the prediction; the residual says the
model agrees with itself ([temporal learning](temporal.md)).

**Learning is slow.** One detuned chain costs on the order of `N * T * H^3`; keep the hidden
width and the path length modest ([scaling](scaling.md)).

## The record patch

**The slow weights learn nothing, the records recall everything.** The loss is a mean over
time and outputs, so the useful `rate` scales with their product; try 8 and let
`backtrack=True` halve it. A rule of the present input is learned in tens of updates; a
conjunction of this input and the last is learned by the gate and takes far longer, or by
a second patch in depth ([two patches in depth](record-patch.md#two-patches-in-depth)).

**The records recall nothing.** Give every unit of the reading unit variance, and count the
cells in use and the share of activations the most active cells take
([diagnosing a record store](record-patch.md#diagnosing-a-record-store)). A store written
hundreds of times per cell holds only its last writers at `record_rate` near one; use
`record_averaging=True` where retention of a corpus matters.

**Sleep changed nothing.** Sleep restructures what the store holds; it does not correct
it. Dreams from cues the store never met teach its guesses as facts. Dream the cues of the
day, and check the slow-weights-alone score on held-out data before and after
([acquisition in two phases](record-patch.md#acquisition-in-two-phases-records-by-day-weights-by-night)).

**Recall by position fails.** A record is keyed by what was heard and the context; if the
same place in a phrase must be recalled after the phase shifted, position has to be in
the reading as ports of its own ([recall is by content](record-patch.md#recall-is-by-content-not-by-position)).

**`detune` refuses categorical ports.** The quadratic detuning result applies to the linear
readout only; `observe` computes the same learning signal by its backward scan for both.

**Which checkpoint format?** Default nets save format 2; a net with `groups` or batch
writes saves format 3. `load` reads both. A structured port's layout is saved with it.

## The belief patch

**Imagination decays while the one-step read improves.** The patch leans on the next frame.
Add the imagination loss: imagine from random moments and penalise the drift of the
imagined output ([the imagination loss](belief.md#training-the-transition-the-imagination-loss)).

**A wide picture port needs a huge rate.** The loss is a mean over time and outputs. Use
a rate in the thousands, or the torch twin with an ordinary optimizer ([belief](belief.md#learning)).

## Evaluation

**Which number do I report?** Held-out data, split before tuning; the slow weights and the
records separately; a control (the majority outcome, persistence, a linear predictor, the
search alone). For categorical ports, mean log loss and calibration beside accuracy
([task design](task-design.md), [scaling](scaling.md)).

**How do I make a result reproducible?** Pin the release or the commit, fix every seed,
and bind the numbers to their sources with a [receipt](receipts.md). The examples
repository's `verify.py` scripts are the pattern.
