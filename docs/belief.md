# The belief patch

`BeliefPatch` keeps a belief that a learned transition carries forward under the action
that was executed, lets the evidence of the moment repair that belief through a few
iterations of one nonlinear map, reads the record store inside those iterations, and
answers through a linear readout the store patches. It is the smallest patch in the
library that can imagine on its own: the record patch's context is computed from the input
of the moment, so without an input it has no next state; the belief patch's transition
needs only the belief and a declared action.

```text
p[t]    = g * z[t-1] + (1 - g) * tanh(T [z[t-1]; a[t-1]] + t_b),   g = sigmoid(G [z; a] + g_b)
e[t]    = tanh(port(o[t]) + e_b)
z(0)    = p[t]
m(k)    = read(code([e[t], z(k)]))
z(k+1)  = (1 - alpha) z(k) + alpha tanh(F [z(k); e[t]; p[t]; m(k); 1] + f_b)      k < K
y[t]    = C z(K) + c + decode(m(K))
```

The three clocks stay apart: the environment's moments `t`, the repair iterations `k`
within a moment with the evidence held fixed, and learning between chunks. An imagined
step is the transition alone, with the store read at the expectation and nothing observed.

## What each part is for

- **The transition** answers what follows under an action. Scene and action meet inside
  the repair map, so the effect of an action can depend on what is where; the guide's test
  is the mixed difference of the belief over an observation and an action, which is zero
  for a port whose blocks never meet and nonzero here.
- **The repair** assimilates evidence: the map reads the belief, the encoded observation,
  the expectation and the store's read together, and moves the belief by a damped step.
  `BeliefPath.step` is the last move per belief unit and `residual` its size; a familiar
  moment ends near zero.
- **The store** holds the residual of the slow readout at the code of the final reading,
  coded to `record_width` signs, written once per observed moment. Its read enters the
  repair and patches the readout. No gradient reaches the store; that is the record
  patch's rule and it stays.
- **Imagination** (`imagine(actions)`) leaves parameters, records, state and counters
  unchanged and consumes no observation. A continuation conditioned on recorded future
  inputs is a different measurement; this method cannot make one.

```python
import numpy as np
from cadence import BeliefPatch, DenseBlock, MapBlock, StructuredPort

# a small retina with the action broadcast into its map, and a dense block of fields
port = StructuredPort(1 * 8 * 8 + 4, [MapBlock(0, 1, 8, 8, 4, 3, 2), DenseBlock(64, 4, 8)], broadcast=(64, 4))
brain = BeliefPatch(port, actions=3, belief=16, outputs=6, iterations=2, cells=256, active=8, record_width=16, seed=0)
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
observations = rng.random((2, 8, port.inputs))         # (N, T, inputs)
actions = rng.random((2, 8, 3))                         # (N, T, actions)
targets = rng.normal(size=(2, 8, 6))                    # (N, T, outputs)
brain.reset()
seen = brain.assimilate(observations, actions)          # the belief follows the evidence
ahead = brain.imagine(actions[:, :4])                   # (N, H, actions): private, from the live belief
learned = brain.observe(observations, actions, targets, rate=1.0)   # one backward scan through every iteration; the store takes the residuals
assert learned.updated and learned.writes == 16
```

## Learning

`observe` computes the adjoint of the precision-weighted half mean squared error through
every repair iteration and the transition over the chunk, treating each store read as
given, and moves the parameters by `rate` times that gradient. The adjoint matches finite
differences to 1e-5 on every parameter group (`tests/test_belief.py`). The loss is a mean
over time and outputs, so the useful rate scales with their product; a wide picture port
needs a rate in the thousands, or the torch backend with an ordinary optimiser.

`belief_torch.TorchBelief` is the same slow half as a torch module with autograd, for
batches of streams on a GPU; `export()` and `load()` move the parameters in the library's
packing, so a patch trained there continues in NumPy with its records. Its `forward` takes
the `gains` and the per-row `observed` mask of the sections below, since the forward is
shared, and a gains tensor that requires grad receives the gradient into the gains; a
weighted loss, an admitted step and an external output gradient are the caller's loss and
optimiser there, and the readback of a moment stays on the library's path.

### Training the transition: the imagination loss

A belief patch trained on the one-step read alone learns to lean on the next frame. The
repair takes what it needs from the evidence, the transition carries less each epoch, and
the imagination decays while the one-step read improves. On Seaquest from pixels the
one-step explained variance of the frame-to-frame change rose from 0.06 to 0.35 over
twenty epochs while the open-loop imagination four decisions ahead fell from 0.03 above
persistence to 0.12 below it. This is teacher forcing, and the unified world-model report's
rule names the repair: a rollout must predict every input it consumes.

The imagination loss trains that. From random moments `t0` of each chunk, imagine `H`
steps under the recorded actions from the belief at `t0 - 1` with no observation, and
penalise the drift of the imagined output from the truth along with the one-step loss:

```text
L = L_one_step + w * mean over starts of  1/2 * mean( W * [cumsum_k(y_hat[t0+k] - y[t0+k]) ; fields]^2 )
```

where the cumulative sum runs over the retina outputs (the imagined retina against the
true one), the fields are compared step by step, and `W` is the same output weighting as
the one-step loss. The gradient flows through the imagined transitions into `T`, `G`, `C`
and back through the repair into the belief the rollout started from, so the belief is
trained to carry what the transition needs. Two starts per chunk, `H = 8` and `w = 0.3`
were enough on Atari: on Pong after twenty epochs the imagination with no observation
explained 0.42, 0.55, 0.62 and 0.61 of the changed cells at one, two, four and eight
decisions and beat persistence on 99 percent of the moments; the one-step read explained
0.76 against 0.70 for a convolutional GRU of the same size, and the imagined danger told
which of the six plans loses the point (area under the curve 0.92 against 0.47 shuffled)
when the emulator was restored to the same moment to try every plan. Not every run takes:
a second seed learned a one-step read of 0.70 and no imagination at all, the transition
having settled on persistence while the repair did the work, so the receipt of every run
carries the open-loop curve and the imagined term's weight is the first knob to raise. The
recipe lives in the application, fifteen lines around the ordinary loss; the library supplies the imagination with a `state` and no observation.

## A gain per block inside the repair

Each block of the observation port carries a gain that multiplies its encoded evidence
before the repair map and the store read see it, `e_b <- gain_b * tanh(E_b o_b + e_b)`, so
the gain acts in every repair iteration and in the store's code, on the equations of the
moment. A weighing applied after the outputs would be a reparameterization the readout
could learn around; a gain inside the repair changes what the belief is repaired toward.
`assimilate`, `observe` and `imagine` take `gains=`, one per block `(blocks,)`, per stream
`(batch, blocks)` or per moment `(batch, time, blocks)`; the adjoint returns the gradient
of the loss into each gain per moment as `gain_gradient`, and the path carries the gains
used. With `de` the gradient into the scaled evidence, the gain's gradient is the sum over
the block's units of `de * e_raw`, and the port's gradient uses `de * gain * (1 - e_raw^2)`.

```python
import numpy as np
from cadence import BeliefPatch, DenseBlock, StructuredPort

eye, ear = DenseBlock(0, 6, 8), DenseBlock(6, 2, 4)                # two senses, two blocks
cortex = BeliefPatch(StructuredPort(8, [eye, ear]), actions=1, belief=8, outputs=2, cells=128, active=4, record_width=8, seed=1)
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
o, a, y = rng.random((4, 6, 8)), np.zeros((4, 6, 1)), rng.normal(size=(4, 6, 2))
cortex.reset()
cortex.observe(o, a, y, rate=1.0, write=False)                    # a readout, so the loss reaches the evidence
gains = np.tile([1.8, 0.2], (4, 6, 1))                            # (N, T, blocks): the eye weighs 1.8, the ear 0.2
cortex.reset()
taught = cortex.observe(o, a, y, rate=0.0, write=False, gains=gains)
assert taught.gain_gradient.shape == (4, 6, 2) and np.abs(taught.gain_gradient).max() > 0
assert np.array_equal(taught.path.gains, gains)
```

A gain that sets weights freely amplifies every sense against the belief; a weighing that
sums to the number of blocks (`blocks * softmax` of a steering patch's outputs, for
instance) moves weight from one sense to another. The map from a steering patch's outputs
to the gains, and its Jacobian for the seam below, are the application's.

## The readback of a moment

`BeliefPath` carries, per moment, what a governor or a steering patch reads and what a
page draws: `evidence` `(batch, time, encoded)`, the encoded evidence the repair and the
store read, after the gains; `code` `(batch, time, cells)`, the store's plain code at the
final reading; `gains` `(batch, time, blocks)`; `residual_alone` `(batch, time, blocks)`,
the repair map's move from the expectation with only that block heard and the store read at
zero, one evaluation of the map per block, computed with `probe=True`; and `surprise`
`(batch, time, blocks)`, each block's reading against the reading the previous belief's
slow readout implies, a root mean square over the block's compared channels in the block's
persistence units (a surprise of one means the belief predicted the sense no better than a
belief that expects the reading to stay as it was). The surprise needs a declaration,
`set_implied_reading(implied, units)`: the map from the outputs to the reading each block
should give, with the channels it does not imply left `NaN`, and the mean squared change of
the compared channels from one moment to the next on a batch of training data. A row that
reads nothing has a zero probe and a zero surprise. `readback(observations, actions,
state=)` gives one moment's expectation, probe and surprise before its repair: a steering
patch reads it, sets the moment's gains, and the moment is then assimilated under them.

```python
def implied(outputs):
    reading = np.full((len(outputs), 8), np.nan)   # channels the map leaves NaN are not compared
    reading[:, :2] = outputs                       # the eye's first two channels read the predicted position
    return reading

cortex.set_implied_reading(implied, units=[0.01, 0.01])   # the persistence error of each block's compared channels
cortex.reset()
path = cortex.assimilate(o, a, gains=gains, probe=True)
assert path.residual_alone.shape == (4, 6, 2) and path.surprise.shape == (4, 6, 2)
assert path.evidence.shape == (4, 6, 12) and path.code.shape == (4, 6, 128)
assert np.all(path.surprise[:, :, 1] == 0.0)       # the ear has no implied channels
moment = cortex.readback(o[:, 0], a[:, 0], state=np.zeros((4, 8)))   # before the first moment's repair
assert np.allclose(moment.residual_alone, path.residual_alone[:, 0])
assert np.allclose(moment.surprise, path.surprise[:, 0])
```

The probes cost one evaluation of the repair map per block and moment; the surprise costs
one call of the declared map. In the ventriloquist demo the steering patch that read the
two surprises alone reached the same held-out error as the one that also read the probes, so
carry the surprise first and ask for the probes when the task shows they help.

## An admitted step

`observe(rate=r)` moves the parameters by `r` times the adjoint. On a loss that is flat
around the mean predictor and steep once the readout binds, every fixed rate that learned
diverged within a few dozen chunks and the rates that stayed finite learned nothing. With
`backtrack=True` the chunk is replayed from the same boundary under the proposed
parameters, with the store as it stands, and the largest halving of `rate` whose replay
lowers the chunk's loss by the Armijo margin is taken, sixteen halvings at most; the store
is written after the admission. `accepted_rate`, `final_loss` and `replay_calls` are on the
observation. The admission is a check, not an optimizer: the patch keeps no step size and
no moments of the gradient, and the next chunk starts again from `rate`.

```python
cortex.reset()
admitted = cortex.observe(o, a, y, rate=100.0, write=False, backtrack=True)
assert admitted.updated and admitted.final_loss < admitted.initial_loss
assert 0 < admitted.accepted_rate < 100.0 and admitted.replay_calls >= 1
```

A rate of 100 on the patch above diverges within two chunks without the admission (the
loss goes from 0.46 to 31 to 1e6) and is admitted with it at 3.1, 1.6 or 6.2, with five to
seven replays per chunk; the loss never rises on an accepted step. A step of `rate` accepted
at the first replay costs one forward pass more than the plain step.

## A weight per moment and a mask per row

`observe(loss_weight=)` weighs each moment's error, `(time,)` or `(batch, time)`, and the
loss and the adjoint normalize by the weight's sum instead of the moment count, so a weight
of ones is the plain loss. A moment of weight zero is neither taught nor written: a jump of
tens of units on the predicted channels (a dot that appears or vanishes) would otherwise
carry more gradient than the chase around it, and its residual would be written into the
cells a quiet field activates, so that the filled store predicted appearances everywhere.
`observed=` is accepted per row as `(batch, time)` as well as per moment as `(time,)`, in
`assimilate`, `observe` and `imagine`; a row that observes nothing keeps its expectation
while the other rows repair, so streams whose screens come down at different moments share
a batch.

```python
weight = np.ones((4, 6))
weight[:, 2] = 0.0                       # the jump moment: neither taught nor written
observed = np.ones((4, 6), dtype=bool)
observed[1, 3:] = False                  # one stream's screen comes down at moment 3
cortex.reset()
masked = cortex.observe(o, a, y, rate=0.0, write=True, loss_weight=weight, observed=observed)
assert masked.writes == int(np.sum(observed & (weight > 0)))
assert np.allclose(masked.path.belief[1, 3], masked.path.expectation[1, 3])   # a row that reads nothing keeps its expectation
assert masked.path.residual[0, 3] > 0.0
```

## Teaching through a seam

A steering patch has no target of its own: its outputs are the gains of another patch's
moment, and what it should have done is what lowers that patch's loss. `observe(...,
output_gradient=dy)` in place of `target` takes an external gradient on the outputs `(batch,
time, outputs)` and carries it through the same backward scan into the parameters and the
gains; nothing is written and no loss is reported. The cortex's `gain_gradient`, passed
through the Jacobian of the caller's map from the steering patch's outputs to the gains, is
that `dy`. With the gradient of the target form, the parameter and gain gradients equal the
target form's exactly.

```python
steering = BeliefPatch(StructuredPort(4, [DenseBlock(0, 4, 6)]), actions=1, belief=6, outputs=2, cells=64, active=4, record_width=4, seed=2)
readbacks = np.concatenate([path.residual_alone, path.surprise], axis=-1)   # (N, T, 4): what the steering patch read
steering.reset()
weighing = steering.assimilate(readbacks, a)                                # its outputs set the gains through the caller's map
d_outputs = taught.gain_gradient                                            # the cortex's loss into the gains, times the map's Jacobian (one for the identity)
steering.reset()
seam = steering.observe(readbacks, a, output_gradient=d_outputs, rate=0.5)
assert seam.updated and seam.writes == 0 and seam.path.loss is None
```

The admission of a joint step (the cortex and the steering patch moved together, one
replay of the cortex's chunk deciding) stays with the caller: `backtrack=True` needs a
target, since the library can replay only the loss it can see. A readback that depends on
the previous moment's prediction is taken as given in the steering patch's adjoint.

## What it does not do

It has no certificate: the repair map is nonlinear and its contraction is measured, not
proved. It does not learn its keys; the store's code is the fixed sparse code of
`Records`. It does not partition the store by action or provenance; those are the
application's declarations. Categorical outputs and the night (`dream`, `sleep`) are the
record patch's; the belief patch's readout is linear.
